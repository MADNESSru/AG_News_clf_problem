# AG News Classification

## üìå Task
The goal of this project is to build a **news classification model** on the **AG News** dataset into four categories:
1. World
2. Sports
3. Business
4. Sci/Tech

---

## üìÇ Project Structure
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing** ‚Äî data loading, cleaning, and vectorization.
- **Model Training** ‚Äî training the Random Forest classifier on vectorized data.
- **Evaluation** ‚Äî evaluating the model on the test set.

---

## üöÄ Implementation Steps
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Loading
- The AG News dataset was loaded and split into training and test sets: `train_x`, `train_y`, `test_x`, `test_y`.
- Basic data analysis and missing value checks were performed.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Text Vectorization
- **CountVectorizer** was used to transform the text data into numerical format.
- The resulting vectorized data was stored in `train_arr` and `test_arr`.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training
- A **RandomForestClassifier** model was selected for classification.
- The model was trained on vectorized data, with labels taken directly from the dataset.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation
- The following metrics were used for evaluation:
  - **Accuracy** ‚Äî overall model accuracy.
  - **Precision** ‚Äî accuracy of predictions for each class.
  - **Recall** ‚Äî completeness of predictions.
  - **F1-score** ‚Äî harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.
- The final results showed good accuracy on the test data.
